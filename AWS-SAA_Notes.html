<h2>AWS Global infrastructure</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://infrastructure.aws">AWS infrastructure</a><br>
    AWS Regions<br>
    AWS Availability Zones<br>
    AWS Data Centers<br>
    AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence<br> 
</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>
<p>
    A cluster of data centers placed all over the world. Most AWS services are regionally scoped.<br><br>
    If you need to launch a new application, where should you do it?<br><br>
    It depends on the following factors:<br>
    1. Compliance to governance & legal requirements: data never leaves a region w/o explicit permission.<br>
    2. Proximity to customers: for reduced latency.<br>
    3. Available Service within a region: new services and new features arent available in every region.<br>
    4. Pricing: this varies region to region. This can be found in the services pricing page.<br>
</p>

<h2>Availability Zones (AZ's)</h2>
<p>
    Each region has between 3 & 6 AZ's.<br>
    Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, & connectivity.<br>
    Each zone is geographically seperated from each other so they are isolated from disaster (weather, terrorism, etc)<br>
    Each AZ is connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking. These connections make the AZ's a region.<br>
</p>

<h2>AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)</h2>
<p>
    200+ Points of Presence, 84 cities, in 42 countries.<br>
    Delivers content to end users with low latency.<br>
</p>

<h2>Services</h2>
<p>
    Service can be found by alphabetical listing, category, or by typing in the search bar.<br>
    Some services are Global, while others are region specific.<br>
    To find which region has which service see: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4">AWS Regional Services</a><br>
    If the service you desire is not listed, change to a region where it is available.
</p>

<h2>IAM - Identity & Access Management</h2>
<p>
    Root Account - created by default and should not be used or shared.<br>
    Users - people within your organization and can be grouped.<br>
    Groups - Permissions are assigned to the group and inherited by each user in the group. Can only contain users, not other groups. Users are not required to be in a group. Users can be in multiple groups.<br>
    Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents call policies.<br>
    Polices - define the permissions of the user using the 'l
    
    <h3>IAM Policies Structure</h3>
    <p>A JSON document containing:<br>
        1. Version: policy language version "year-month-day"<br>
        2. ID: identifier for policy (Optional)<br>
        3. Statement: Required and 1 or more individual statements.<br><br>
        Inside of a statement are:<br>
        1. SID: Statement ID (Optional)<br>
        2. Effect: Whether the statement allows or denys access.<br>
        3. Principal: Account, user, or role to which a policy is applied to.<br>
        4. Action: list of resources to which action applies to.<br>     
        5. Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to.<br>
        6. Condition: for when this policy is in effect.(Optional)<br>
    </p>
</p>

<h2>IAM - passwords</h2>
<p>
    You can setup password policies in AWS. Policies like:<br>
    -Minimum password lengths.<br>
    -Require special characters like: upper & lower case letters, numers, and special characters.</a><br>
    You can also allow users to change their own passwords.<br>
    You can require them to change their password after a designated password age<br>
    You can prevent password reuse<br>
</p>

<h2>IAM - MFA</h2>
<p>
    Users have access to your account and can change/add/delete. things that they have permissions to.<br>
    Protecting Root and IAM users with MFA is crucial<br>
    MFA = Password that you know + a sercurity device you own.</a><br>
    The benefit of MFA is that if your account credentials are stolen your account is still safe.<br>
    You can require them to change their password after a designated password age.<br>
    You can prevent password reuse.<br><br>

    Devices that can be used for MFA:<br>
    1. Google Authenticator (phone only)(virtual MFA Device). This can support multiple tokesn on a single device.<br>
    2. Authy (multi device)(virtual MFA Device). This can support multiple tokesn on a single device.<br>
    3. YubiKey(Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key). This supports multiple root & IAM users using a single key.<br>
    4. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device, provided by Gemalto<br>
    5. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud, if you are in the USG, provided by SurePassID<br>
