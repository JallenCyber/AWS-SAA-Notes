<h2>AWS Global infrastructure</h2>
<p>
    <a href="https://infrastructure.aws">AWS infrastructure</a><br>
    AWS Regions<br>
    AWS Availability Zones<br>
    AWS Data Centers<br>
    AWS Edge Locations/Points of Presence<br> 
</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>
<p>
    A cluster of data centers placed all over the world. Most AWS services are regionally scoped.<br><br>
    If you need to launch a new application, where should you do it?<br><br>
    It depends on the following factors:<br>
    1. Compliance to governance & legal requirements: data never leaves a region w/o explicit permission.<br>
    2. Proximity to customers: for reduced latency.<br>
    3. Available Service within a region: new services and new features arent available in every region.<br>
    4. Pricing: this varies region to region. This can be found in the services pricing page.<br>
</p>

<h2>Availability Zones (AZ's)</h2>
<p>
    Each region has between 3 & 6 AZ's.<br>
    Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, & connectivity.<br>
    Each zone is geographically seperated from each other so they are isolated from disaster (weather, terrorism, etc)<br>
    Each AZ is connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking. These connections make the AZ's a region.<br>
</p>

<h2>AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)</h2>
<p>
    200+ Points of Presence, 84 cities, in 42 countries.<br>
    Delivers content to end users with low latency.<br>
</p>

<h2 >Services</h2>
<p>
    Service can be found by alphabetical listing, category, or by typing in the search bar.<br>
    Some services are Global, while others are region specific.<br>
    To find which region has which service see: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4">AWS Regional Services</a><br>
    If the service you desire is not listed, change to a region where it is available.
</p>

<h2 style="color:red;">IAM - Identity & Access Management</h2>
<p>
    Root Account - created by default and should not be used or shared.<br>
    Users - people within your organization and can be grouped.<br>
    Groups - Permissions are assigned to the group and inherited by each user in the group. Can only contain users, not other groups. Users are not required to be in a group. Users can be in multiple groups.<br>
    Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents call policies.<br>
    Polices - define the permissions of the user using the 'l
    
    <h3>IAM Policies Structure</h3>
    <p>A JSON document containing:<br>
        1. Version: policy language version "year-month-day"<br>
        2. ID: identifier for policy (Optional)<br>
        3. Statement: Required and 1 or more individual statements.<br><br>
        Inside of a statement are:<br>
        1. SID: Statement ID (Optional)<br>
        2. Effect: Whether the statement allows or denys access.<br>
        3. Principal: Account, user, or role to which a policy is applied to.<br>
        4. Action: list of resources to which action applies to.<br>     
        5. Resource: list of resources to which the actions applied to.<br>
        6. Condition: for when this policy is in effect.(Optional)<br>
    </p>
</p>

<h2>IAM - passwords</h2>
<p>
    You can setup password policies in AWS. Policies like:<br>
    -Minimum password lengths.<br>
    -Require special characters like: upper & lower case letters, numers, and special characters.</a><br>
    You can also allow users to change their own passwords.<br>
    You can require them to change their password after a designated password age<br>
    You can prevent password reuse<br>
</p>

<h2>IAM - MFA</h2>
<p>
    Users have access to your account and can change/add/delete. things that they have permissions to.<br>
    Protecting Root and IAM users with MFA is crucial<br>
    MFA = Password that you know + a sercurity device you own.</a><br>
    The benefit of MFA is that if your account credentials are stolen your account is still safe.<br>
    You can require them to change their password after a designated password age.<br>
    You can prevent password reuse.<br><br>

    Devices that can be used for MFA:<br>
    1. Google Authenticator (phone only)(virtual MFA Device). This can support multiple tokesn on a single device.<br>
    2. Authy (multi device)(virtual MFA Device). This can support multiple tokesn on a single device.<br>
    3. YubiKey(Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key). This supports multiple root & IAM users using a single key.<br>
    4. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device, provided by Gemalto<br>
    5. Hardware Key Fob MFA Device for AWS GovCloud, if you are in the USG, provided by SurePassID<br>
</p>

<h2>Ways to access AWS</h2>
<p>
    There are three options for accessing AWS.<br>
    1. AWS management console with username, password, and MFA.<br>
    2. AWS command line interface (CLI): protected by access keys.</a><br>
    3. Aws Software Developer Kit (SDK) - for code: protected by access keys.<br>
    Access keys are generated in the console.<br>
    Users manage their own keys.<br>
    Access keys are secret, just like passwords that should not be shared.<br>
    Access Key ID == username<br>
    Secret Access Key == password<br>
</p>

<h2>CLI</h2>
<p>
    A tool the enables you to interact with AWS service using commands in a command-line shell.<br>
    Direct access to the public API's of AWS services.<br>
    You can develop scripts to manage your services.</a><br>
    It's open source: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli">AWS CLI GitHub</a><br>
    Alternative to using AWS Managment Console<br>
</p>

<h2>SDK</h2>
<p>
    Language Specific API's<br>
    Enables you to access and manage AWS services programmatically<br>
    Embedded within your application</a><br>
    Supports:</a><br>
    -SKD's (JS, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, GO, Node.js, C++)<br>
    -Mobile SDK's (Android, iOS, ..)<br>
    -IoT Device SDK's (Embedded C, Ardunio,..)<br>
    Example: AWS CLI is built on ASW SDK for Python.<br>
</p>

<h2>AWS CloudShell</h2>
<p>
    It is not available in all regions.<br>
    Available regions are here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/supported-aws-regions.html">AWS Cloudshell Region Availability</a><br>
    Icon similar to PowerShell icon<br>
    Alternative from using CMD,Terminal to manage AWS.<br>
    Any files made in CloudShell will remain.<br>
    You can upload & download in CloudShell<br>
</p>

<h2>IAM Roles for Services</h2>
<p>
    Some AWS services will need to perform actions on your behalf.<br>
    To allow this, we will assign permissions to AWS services with IAM roles.<br>
    Common Roles:<br>
    1. EC2 Instance<br>
    2. Lambda Function Roles<br>
    3. Roles for CloudFormation<br>
</p>

<h2>IAM Security Tools</h2>
<p>
    1. IAM credentials report (account-level)<br>
    -a report that lists all your account's users and the stauts of their various credentials.<br><br>
    2. IAM Access Advisore (user-level)<br>
    -access advisore shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services where last accessed<br>
    -you can use this Information to revise your policies to re-enforce 'least Privilege'.<br>
</p>

<h2>IAM Summary</h2>
<p>
    Users: mapped to a physical user, has a password for AWS Console.<br>
    Groups: contains users only.<br>
    Policies: JSON document that outlines permissions for users & groups.<br>
    Roles: for EC2 Instances or AWS services.<br>
    Security: MFA + Password Policy.<br>
    AWS CLI: manage your AWS services using the command line.<br>
    AWS SDK: manage AWS services using a programming language<br>
    Access Keys: access AWS using the CLI or SDK.<br>
    Audit: IAM credential Reports & IAM Access Advisor.<br>
</p>

<h2 style="color:red;">EC2 Fundamentals</h2>
<p>
    Knowing EC2 is fundamental to how the cloud works<br>
    EC2 = Elastic Cloud Computing = IaaS<br>
    EC2 is one of the most popular AWS services.<br>
    EC2 mainly consists in the capability of:<br>
    1. Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)<br>
    2. Storing data on virtual drives, Elastic Block Store (EBS)<br>
    3. Distributing load across machines, Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)<br>
    4. Scaling the service using an auto scaling group (ASG)<br><br>

    <h2>EC2 sizing and configuration options</h2>
    You can choose:<br>
    Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows, or MacOS.<br>
    How much computing power and cores (CPU).<br>
    How much memory (RAM).<br>
    How much storage space being network attached (EBS & EFS) or hardware (EC2 Instance Store).<br>
    Network card to include the speed of the card and public IP address.<br>
    Firewall rules done in the security group.br>
    Bootstrap script (configure at first launch) with EC2 user data.<br>

    <h2>EC2 User Data (Bootstrap)</h2>
    It's possible to bootstrap our instances using EC2 User Data Scripts.<br>
    Bootstrapping means launching of commands when a machine starts.<br>
    The script only runs once at the instance first start.<br>
    The EC2 User Data Script runs with the Root user.<br>
    EC2 User data is used to automate boot tasks such as:<br>
    1. Installing updates.<br>
    2. Installing Software.<br>
    3. Download common files from the internet.<br>
    4. Anything you can think of.<br>
    **The more you have bootstrapped the more the instance has to do at startup, the longer it could take.<br>
